# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will design and make a digital ledger for a client who is Ms.Sato. The ledger will be about MANA which is a digital asset token used to pay for goods and sevices on Decentraland, a virtual world where users can buy, develop, and sell land [1]. This ledger will be constructed using the software Python. It will take approximately 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria below.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger displays the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger displays MANA coverted to USD.
5. The electronic ledger allows the client to add a side note about her transactions. 
6. The electronic ledger allows the client to type the date and search for past transactions.
